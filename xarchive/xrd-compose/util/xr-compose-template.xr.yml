# Introduction
# ------------
# This file documents the schema for the input YAML file to be passed to the
# xr-compose script.
#
# xr-compose translates the XR keywords documented in this template to the full
# docker-compose YAML that is used to bring up topologies of XRd Docker
# containers.
#
# This file is not intended as a bootable sample topology, e.g. it does not
# refer to real config file paths.
#
# See samples/ for some fully-formed examples that can be booted.
#

# Notes
# -----
#  - Any docker-compose fields are valid e.g. 'image' and 'container_name'
#    fields may be specified for an XR service.
#
#  - See the docker-compose reference
#    (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) for more information on
#    the docker-compose YAML schema.
#
#  - The added XR keywords all start with 'xr_', with the one exception of the
#    'non_xr' field.
#
#  - XR keywords will be expanded out to valid docker-compose YAML by
#    xr-compose.
#
#  - Boilerplate docker-compose fields such as 'version', 'stdin_open', 'tty',
#    and 'privileged' that are required for each container will be filled in
#    with default values if not specified.
#
#  - Each container will have a volume generated to store data that should be
#    persistent across multiple boots.
#

services:
  xr-1:
    # The loaded XRd image must be specified either here or using the '--image'
    # CLI option to xr-compose.
    image: ios-xr:7.4.1
    # A container name will be generated from the service name and the topology
    # identifier if one is not specified.
    # The topology identifier may be specified as an input argument to
    # xr-compose, otherwise being generated with the format <username>-<cwd>.
    container_name: xr-1
    # Optionally specify a path to startup XR config for this service. Relative
    # paths are interpreted as relative to the input YAML file.

    # configuration has been applied
    xr_boot_script: /path/to/boot_script
    # Optionally specify XR interfaces for this service to have. Valid
    # interfaces are currently:
    # - GigabitEthernet interfaces:
    #     Gi0/0/0/x
    # - MgmtEthernet interfaces:
    #     Mg0/RP0/CPU0/0
    # The following optional per-interface flags may be set:
    # - chksum: This interface should have checksum offload counteract enabled.
    #     This defaults to True for any interfaces in non-L2 networks
    #     (predefined Docker network), in anticipation of XR to non-XR
    #     connectivity which requires the counteract behavior.
    # - snoop_v[4|6]: This interface should have XR interface IPv4/v6 address
    #     configuration added to it, using the IP addresses assigned by the
    #     container orchestrator. Defaults to False.
    # - snoop_v[4|6]_default_route: This interface should have XR IPv4/6
    #     default route configuration added, using the default route assigned
    #     by the container orchestrator. Defaults to False.

# created to supply an interface, but will not be connected to any

# Note that the syntax here corresponds to a list of lists - a list of networks,
# each represented as a list of interfaces belonging to specified containers.
